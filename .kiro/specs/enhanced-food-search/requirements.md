# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the food search and tracking experience by implementing direct calorie estimation from food descriptions, eliminating the need for manual weight input, and adding edit functionality for tracked meals. The system will use OpenAI GPT-4o with optimized prompts to provide accurate, instant nutrition data similar to ChatGPT's response quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for food items and get instant calorie and nutrition information without having to specify weights or quantities manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type a food description in the search bar THEN the system SHALL automatically parse the description and provide nutrition data
2. WHEN I enter "1 cup chai with sugar" THEN the system SHALL return structured nutrition data for chai and sugar separately
3. WHEN I enter vague descriptions like "some rice" THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults for portion sizes
4. WHEN the nutrition data is returned THEN it SHALL include calories, protein, carbs, fat, and fiber for each item
5. WHEN multiple food items are detected THEN each item SHALL be displayed separately with individual nutrition values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit the quantity of food items I've already added to my daily intake.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view my daily meals THEN each meal item SHALL have an "Edit" button
2. WHEN I click the "Edit" button THEN the system SHALL open the food item editor with current values pre-filled
3. WHEN I modify the quantity in the editor THEN the system SHALL recalculate nutrition values in real-time
4. WHEN I save the edited item THEN the daily totals SHALL update automatically
5. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the original values SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search bar to provide helpful tips and examples to get more accurate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I focus on the search bar THEN it SHALL display placeholder text with example formats
2. WHEN the search bar is empty THEN it SHALL show "Write food items with quantity for accurate results (e.g., '2 rotis with dal')"
3. WHEN I start typing THEN the placeholder SHALL remain visible until I type substantial content
4. WHEN I submit a search THEN the system SHALL highlight the parsed food items in the results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use an optimized ChatGPT-like prompt system for accurate calorie estimation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes food descriptions THEN it SHALL use the structured prompt format with system role and few-shot examples
2. WHEN processing Indian foods THEN the system SHALL use appropriate portion sizes and traditional recipes
3. WHEN handling vague inputs THEN the system SHALL normalize them to standard estimates
4. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL provide structured JSON with individual items and total calories
5. WHEN an input is unclear THEN the system SHALL make intelligent assumptions rather than asking for clarification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration between the enhanced search and existing meal tracking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I get nutrition results from search THEN I SHALL be able to add them directly to my daily intake
2. WHEN adding multiple items from one search THEN each item SHALL be added as a separate meal entry
3. WHEN items are added THEN they SHALL appear in the appropriate meal category (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
4. WHEN viewing meal history THEN edited items SHALL show their current values, not original values
5. WHEN the daily totals are calculated THEN they SHALL include all original and edited meal values
